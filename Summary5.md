### **1. Using "Quand" with the Conditional Present**

The **conditional present (le conditionnel présent)** is used to describe hypothetical situations, often expressing what **would happen** if certain conditions were met. When "quand" is used with the conditional present, it often links two hypothetical actions.

#### **Example Sentences:**
- **Quand tu **serais** riche, tu **achèterais** une grande maison.**
  - **Translation:** When you would be rich, you would buy a big house.

- **Quand il **aurait** le temps, il **voyagerait** autour du monde.**
  - **Translation:** When he would have the time, he would travel around the world.

- **Quand nous **voudrions** sortir, il **pleuvrait** toujours.**
  - **Translation:** When we would want to go out, it would always rain.

In these sentences, "quand" is used to describe conditions that are imagined or hypothetical, using the conditional present for both verbs.

### **2. Using "Quand" with L'Imparfait**

The **imperfect tense (l'imparfait)** is used to describe ongoing or repeated actions in the past, as well as setting the scene or background information. When "quand" is paired with l'imparfait, it often describes situations or actions that were happening **when** something else occurred.

#### **Example Sentences:**
- **Quand j'étais** enfant, je **jouais** au parc tous les jours.
  - **Translation:** When I was a child, I used to play in the park every day.

- **Quand il **pleuvait**, nous **restions** à la maison.**
  - **Translation:** When it was raining, we stayed at home.

- **Quand elle **travaillait** à Paris, elle **prenait** le métro chaque matin.**
  - **Translation:** When she was working in Paris, she took the metro every morning.

In these examples, "quand" introduces a past action or situation that was ongoing or habitual, and both verbs are in the imperfect tense.

### **Combining "Quand" with Different Tenses**

You can also combine "quand" with different tenses to express more complex ideas:

#### **Quand + Imparfait + Passé Composé:**
This structure is used when an ongoing action in the past (l'imparfait) is interrupted by another action (passé composé).

- **Quand je **lisais**, le téléphone **a sonné**.**
  - **Translation:** When I was reading, the phone rang.

- **Quand nous **dînions**, quelqu'un **a frappé** à la porte.**
  - **Translation:** When we were having dinner, someone knocked at the door.

#### **Quand + Future Perfect + Future Simple:**
This combination is used to talk about a sequence of actions in the future.

- **Quand tu **auras terminé** ton travail, tu **pourras** partir.**
  - **Translation:** When you have finished your work, you will be able to leave.

- **Quand nous **aurons** économisé assez d'argent, nous **achèterons** une maison.**
  - **Translation:** When we have saved enough money, we will buy a house.

Certainly! Here's an explanation of the lesson focused on using "quand" and "pendant que" with the future tense (Le Futur Simple) in French.

### **Lesson: Using "Quand" and "Pendant Que" with Le Futur Simple in French**

#### **Introduction**
In French, when you talk about future events, it's important to know that the structure differs slightly from English. Specifically, when you use "quand" (when) or "pendant que" (while) in sentences that describe actions that will happen in the future, both verbs should be in the future tense. This is different from English, where the verb following "when" or "while" is usually in the present tense.

#### **Examples**
Let's look at some examples to understand this better:

- **English:** When I am old, I will have a house.
- **French:** Quand je **serai** vieux, je **serai** riche.

Notice how both verbs, "serai" (will be) and "serai" (will be), are in the future tense in French. In English, "am" is in the present tense, but in French, you must use the future tense for both verbs.

Here are more examples:

- **Quand tu **viendras**, tu **verras** la nouvelle cuisine.**
  - **Translation:** When you come, you will see the new kitchen.
  
- **Quand Thomas **sera** à l'université, nous **déménagerons**.**
  - **Translation:** When Thomas is at university, we will move out.

- **Quand elle **aura** des enfants, elle **changera** d'avis.**
  - **Translation:** When she has children, she will change her mind.

In each case, the verbs after "quand" are in the future tense in French.

#### **Using "Pendant Que"**
The same rule applies to "pendant que" (while) when talking about future actions:

- **Tu **feras** tes devoirs pendant que je **ferai** la vaisselle.**
  - **Translation:** You will do your homework while I do the dishes.

- **Mathieu **viendra** te voir pendant que je **serai** chez le docteur.**
  - **Translation:** Mathieu will come and see you while I am at the doctor's.

- **Pendant que nous **finirons** de manger, il vous **montrera** ses tableaux.**
  - **Translation:** While we finish eating, he will show you his paintings.

### **Summary:**
- **Quand + Conditional Present:** Used for hypothetical situations where both actions are imagined or conditional.
- **Quand + L'Imparfait:** Used for describing ongoing or repeated past actions, often setting the scene.
- **Quand + Imparfait + Passé Composé:** Describes an ongoing past action interrupted by another action.
- **Quand + Future Perfect + Future Simple:** Describes a sequence of actions in the future.

By using "quand" with these different tenses, you can express a wide range of temporal relationships in both hypothetical and past situations.
