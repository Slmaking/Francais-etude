| 3rd person plural       | leur            | *Je leur parle.*                                 | I speak to them.                            |

### **Usage Notes:**

- **COD (Direct Object)**:
  - Replaces a noun that directly receives the action of the verb.
  - No preposition is used.
  - *Example:* *Je vois Marie.* → *Je la vois.* (I see her.)
  
- **COI (Indirect Object)**:
  - Replaces a noun that receives the action of the verb indirectly, often with the preposition "à."
  - *Example:* *Je parle à Marie.* → *Je lui parle.* (I speak to her.)

### Key Differences:

- **"y"** is used to replace locations or phrases introduced by "à."
- **"en"** is used to replace phrases that begin with "de" or indicate quantity.
- **COD** pronouns replace direct objects, answering "what?" or "whom?" in the sentence.
- **COI** pronouns replace indirect objects, answering "to whom?" or "for whom?" in the sentence.
- **Tonique** pronouns (also called "stress pronouns" or "disjunctive pronouns") are used to emphasize the subject or object or after prepositions. They can also be used in sentences without a verb or to emphasize contrast. penser à qqn = tonique
