Here’s a table summarizing the usage of **pronoms toniques**, **en**, and **y** in French:

### **1. Pronoms Toniques**

Pronoms toniques (or disjunctive pronouns) are used for emphasis, after prepositions, or after certain verbs. They are also used when the subject is more than one person.

| **Person** | **Pronom Tonique** | **Usage Example**                                        | **English Translation**                     |
|------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1st person singular    | moi                | *C'est pour moi.*                                          | It's for me.                                |
| 2nd person singular    | toi                | *Je pense à toi.*                                          | I think of you.                             |
| 3rd person singular    | lui (m), elle (f)  | *Il parle de lui.* (He talks about him.) *Je vais avec elle.* | He talks about him. / I am going with her.  |
| 1st person plural      | nous               | *C'est à nous.*                                            | It's ours.                                  |
| 2nd person plural      | vous               | *Je viens avec vous.*                                      | I'm coming with you.                        |
| 3rd person plural      | eux (m), elles (f) | *Ils comptent sur eux.* *Elles pensent à elles.*           | They count on them. / They think about themselves. |

### **2. Pronom "En"**

The pronoun "en" replaces de + a noun or quantity and means "some," "any," "of it," "of them," etc.

| **Usage**                              | **Example**                                       | **English Translation**                    |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Replaces "de" + thing or quantity      | *Tu as des pommes?* **Oui, j'en ai.**             | Do you have apples? Yes, I have some.      |
| Replaces "de" + verb + infinitive      | *Tu veux du café?* **Non, je n'en veux pas.**     | Do you want coffee? No, I don't want any.  |
| Replaces "de" + place                  | *Tu viens de la bibliothèque?* **Oui, j'en viens.** | Are you coming from the library? Yes, I'm coming from there. |

### **3. Pronom "Y"**

The pronoun "y" replaces "à" + a place or a thing, and it means "there" or "to it."

| **Usage**                          | **Example**                                     | **English Translation**                   |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Replaces "à" + a place             | *Tu vas à Paris?* **Oui, j'y vais.**            | Are you going to Paris? Yes, I am going there. |
| Replaces "à" + thing (not person)  | *Tu penses à ton travail?* **Oui, j'y pense.**  | Are you thinking about your work? Yes, I'm thinking about it. |

### **Notes:**

- **En** is used for quantities and things preceded by "de," and can also replace a noun when talking about an unspecified amount (e.g., *J'en veux* - I want some).
- **Y** replaces locations (often after verbs like *aller* - to go, *être* - to be) and things introduced by "à."
- **Pronoms toniques** emphasize the subject or object, are used after prepositions, and in certain cases with verbs like *penser à* (to think of).

These pronouns help avoid repetition and make sentences more concise in French.
